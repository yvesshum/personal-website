# Yves' Personal website 👋

Hi! If you're seeing this page then you've reached the repository for my personal website at https://yvesshum.com

I kind-of built this website in a hurry so my code is very messy and I'm not proud of it 😅.

This website was built in React

## How to run? 

1. Install dependencies by doing `yarn install`
2. Run the webserver with `yarn start`
